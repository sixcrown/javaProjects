# javaProjects
5 university java projects, pretty much the same project rewritten in different techniques:<br>
first one: consists MVC application architecture and javaFX, results stored in model's collection<br>
2.) communication through TCP/IP protocol, divided into 2 projects, client and server<br>
3.) communication through https request/response using servlets, also divided into client and server,<br>
4.) results are stored database instead of collection in model class, rest is same as 3,<br>
5.) uses object relational mapping(Persistence), web services (soap protocol) <br>
