# javaProjects
5 university java projects, pretty much the same project rewritten in different techniques:
first one: consists MVC application architecture and javaFX, results stored in model's collection
2.) communication through TCP/IP protocol, divided into 2 projects, client and server
3.) communication through https request/response using servlets, also divided into client and server,
4.) results are stored database instead of collection in model class, rest is same as 3,
5.) uses object relational mapping(Persistence), web services (soap protocol)
